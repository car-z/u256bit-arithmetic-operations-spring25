# u256bit-arithmetic-operations-spring25

Implementing a C library for arithmetic operations on a 256-bit unsigned integer data type.
Unit tests to verify functionality of all functions created and included. 

Included Operations:
- constructor
- constructor from 32-bit unsigned integer data type
- constructor from hex data type
- operator to get 32 bits of data from uint256
- function to check if bit at argument index is set
- function to format uint256 as a hex number
- addition of two uint256 numbers
- subtraction of two uint256 numbers
- negation of a uint256 number
- multiplication of two uint256 numbers
- left shift (multiplication by 2) of a uint256 number
